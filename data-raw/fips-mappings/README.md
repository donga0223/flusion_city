# FIPS mappings and HHS region information

The file `fips_mappings.csv` contains metadata about US states, districts, and territories. These were adapted from `https://github.com/reichlab/covid19-forecast-hub/blob/master/data-locations/locations.csv`, and I added in HHS region designations for each state by hand. These designations can be found at https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html.
