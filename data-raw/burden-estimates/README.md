# Influenza burden estimates

Estimates of seasonal influenza burden were taken from
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/past-seasons.html on September 26, 2023 and
saved in the file `data-raw/burden-estimates/burden-estimates.csv`. At that time, final estimates were not yet available for the 2022/2023 season. For that season, we obtained an approximate value of 475,000 as the midpoint of the range of the final in-season estimate at https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm, which was listed as 300,000 to 650,000.
